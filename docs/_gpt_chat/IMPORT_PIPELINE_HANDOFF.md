# Import Pipeline Handoff

## Current Status

- `importers/` package is now the canonical location for all import functions (`import_assignments.py`, `import_files.py`, `import_modules.py`, `import_pages.py`, `import_quizzes.py`).
- All importer tests pass.
- Old `import/` package removed and replaced references in tests/docs.
- Branch: `refactor/import-pipeline` — up to date after merging `refactor/rename-import-package`.

## Next Steps (Short Term)

1. **Finish import pipeline**:

   - Implement remaining importer modules if not done (double-check `import_discussions` or any missing).
   - Confirm metadata and file outputs match export structure (esp. for `combine_metadata.py` compatibility).
   - Ensure API pagination is handled consistently.

2. **Final test pass**:

   - Run:
     ```bash
     pytest -q tests/test_import*
     ```
   - Fix any test drift after refactor.

3. **Push changes**:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "feat(import): complete import pipeline, update tests and docs"
   git push origin refactor/import-pipeline
   Open PR into main (or next integration branch):
   ```

bash
Copy
Edit
gh pr create \
 --base main \
 --head refactor/import-pipeline \
 --title "feat(import): complete import pipeline" \
 --body "Implements full import pipeline with updated structure and passing tests."
Next Steps (Longer Term)
After merge, start a new branch for export test fixes.

Bring export functions up to the same type hint + logging + metadata consistency standard.

Clean up legacy tests after all refactors are done.

# Session Pickup Notes

## Where You Left Off

- Currently on branch: `refactor/import-pipeline`
- Importer refactor is complete and passing tests.
- Export tests still failing — postponed until import pipeline is fully done and merged.

## Immediate Next Task

- Continue implementing and testing the import pipeline.
- When ready, commit/push and merge into main or the integration branch.

## Context Reminders

- Imports now live in `importers/` — all tests, docs, and references updated.
- API calls use `utils/api.py`’s `CanvasAPI` with `source_api` / `target_api`.
- Consistent metadata formats (for later export/import parity).

## Commands to Resume

```bash
# Make sure branch is clean
git status

# Run importer tests
pytest -q tests/test_import*

# Commit and push when ready
git add -A
git commit -m "feat(import): complete import pipeline"
git push origin refactor/import-pipeline
After Merge
New branch for export refactor and test repair.

Avoid mixing import + export changes in the same branch.
